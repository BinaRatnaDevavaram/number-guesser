## 💡 How It Works

- The user is prompted to enter a maximum number between 5 and 10  
- A random number is generated within that range  
- The player keeps guessing until they get it right  
- If the user gives invalid input, the game plays an angry sound and shows a rage GIF  
- When the user wins, a party GIF pops up and a celebration sound plays
